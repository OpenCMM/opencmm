An opensource on-machine CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) system

## Introduction
This project is an opensource on-machine CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) system. It can be used to measure the workpiece on the CNC machine without removing the workpiece from the machine.

## How it works:

1. exports a stl file from a cad/cam software
2. access to an desktop app and upload the stl file
3. download gcode
4. start the cnc machine with the gcode
5. see the result with the desktop app

## Goal
10 micron precision
