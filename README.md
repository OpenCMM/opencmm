An opensource on-machine 3D Scanner CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) system

## Introduction
This project is an opensource on-machine CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) system.

## Features
This is a list of features that we are aiming to implement in the OpenCMM project.

### Automatic Scan
OpenCMM automatically scans the workpiece after the machining process, reducing measurement time and enhancing measurement accuracy.

### 50Âµm Accuracy
While 3D scanners are generally less accurate than touch probes, OpenCMM will provide enough accuracy to check if the workpiece meets the general machining tolerance.

### Universal Compatibility
OpenCMM is compatible with any CNC machine, requiring no wiring or modifications. It seamlessly integrates with 3-axis and 5-axis machines, as well as machines from any brand.


## Development Status
OpenCMM is currently in the early stages of development. Both hardware and software are being developed in parallel. For software development, we are using Blender to simulate the 3D scanning process.
