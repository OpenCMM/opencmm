An image-based CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) system for CNC machine tools

## Introduction
This project is an image-based CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine) system for CNC machine tools. It can be used to measure the workpiece on the CNC machine tool without removing the workpiece from the machine tool.


## Goal
- 1 micron precision
- save centering and measuring time
